# Coursera Data Science Specialization Course 6 Project 1 Script


# The purpose of this script is to satisfy the requirements of the project 1
# peer-graded assignment that is part of the Statistical Inference course
# within the Data Science Specialization on Coursera. As per the instructions
# the project will consist of the two parts outlined below.
#
# The first part is a simulation exercise which will simulate 1000 averages of
# 40 exponentials and then:
# 1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the
# distribution
# 2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the
# theoretical variance of the distribution
# 3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal
#
# The second part focuses on basic inferential data analysis. The steps are:
# 1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analysis
# 2. Provide a basic summary of the data
# 3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by
# supp and dose.
# 4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions
